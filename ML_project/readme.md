## Usage

In order to use it, just prepend this fragment to the URL of any HTML file: **[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?)

 - https://github.com/yuxi16/course_practice/blob/master/ML_project/mlproject.html
 
What it does is: load HTML using CORS proxy, then process all links, frames, scripts and styles, and load each of them using CORS proxy, so they can be evaluated by the browser.

**GitHub & BitBucket HTML Preview** was tested under the latest Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
